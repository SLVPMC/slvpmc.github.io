Welcome.    

## Longstanding Membership

This section will cover longstanding membership and what it means in the context of SLVP. A longstanding member is a person who has been active on a server previously owned or staffed by Ash or Isaac.    
    
This section will go through every potential case.    

### CubeBuilders
